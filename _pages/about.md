# About me

I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/), [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) advised by [Yoshua Bengio](https://mila.quebec/en/yoshua-bengio/). I am interested in adapting causal inference methods to gene expression data in order to better understand cellular regulatory mechanisms. Recently, I have been working on assessing the usefulness of gene interaction graphs as prior knowledge for machine learning models.

I was born in Paris in 1994 and lived in Paris and Bergerac before moving to Montréal. I hold a masters degree in Machine Learning from [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) and a diplôme de l'[École polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) (France). More details can be found in my [resumé](https://Bertinus.github.io/files/Resume.pdf).
