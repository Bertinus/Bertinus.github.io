# About me

I am a PhD candidate in Machine Learning at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/), [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) 
advised by [Yoshua Bengio](https://mila.quebec/en/yoshua-bengio/). My research focuses on developing biologically grounded 
machine learning approaches to model the response of cells to biological perturbations, with the goal of providing 
insights and recommendations to experimentalists.

Currently, I am working on structured models of cell transcriptional dynamics at genome scale, aiming to uncover 
genetic interactions from single-cell transcriptomic data. This work was partially carried out during my visit to the 
[Theis Lab](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/research-groups/theis-lab) at Helmholtz Munich.
Earlier in my PhD, I led the development of a *lab-in-the-loop* approach for guiding drug combination screening assays, 
which was prospectively validated through
a collaboration with [Relation Therapeutics](https://www.relationrx.com/) and [Scripps Research](https://www.scripps.edu/). 
I also investigated the applicability of causal inference methods to transcriptomic data.

I hold a Master's degree in Machine Learning from [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) 
and I graduated from [École polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) in Paris. More details can be found in my 
[résumé](https://Bertinus.github.io/files/Resume.pdf).

I grew up in Paris and Bergerac before moving to Montréal. Outside the lab, I enjoy improvision theatre, climbing 
(top rope, lead and bouldering), and discovering hidden corners of Montréal.
